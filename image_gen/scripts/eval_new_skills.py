# Skill 4: awesome-nano-banana-pro-prompts style (10.5k stars)
#   Method: Extremely detailed narrative prompts drawn from community
#   patterns across 12,000+ curated examples. Very specific about
#   camera settings, materials, exact spatial layout, artistic references.
#   Tends to be longer and more "production-ready" than typical skill prompts.

        "flannel shirt collar peeking out underneath — a quintessential 90s preppy look. "
        "Behind them is the iconic yearbook laser beam backdrop: vivid neon beams of cyan, "
        "electric blue, and hot magenta radiating outward from behind the subject's head "
        "against a deep cobalt blue gradient. The lighting is classic school photo studio: "
        "dual umbrella flash from 45 degrees left and right, creating soft even illumination "
        "with gentle catch-lights in the eyes. Shot on Kodak Gold 200 film with a slight warm "
        "color shift, visible but subtle film grain, and the characteristic slightly desaturated "
        "reds of 90s school photography. The print has soft vignetting at corners as if scanned "
        "from a yearbook page. Square 1:1 format. The subject's facial features, bone structure, "
        "eye shape, and overall identity must be preserved exactly from the input selfie. "

        "The jacket specifics: medium-wash indigo with natural fading at stress points "
        "(elbows, chest pocket edges), two symmetrical chest flap pockets with antique brass "
        "snap buttons, exposed contrast-orange chain stitching along the yoke seams, a "
        "structured fold-down collar, and the jacket is buttoned up to the second-from-top "
        "button with the collar lying flat. The denim texture shows a visible twill weave "

        "gravel path, green grass, the entire alpine lake, mountain range, snow-capped peaks, "
        "forested hillsides, overcast sky, and wooden dock in the background. Camera angle, "
        "focal length, depth of field, and color grading must remain identical.\n"

        "natural fabric-to-skin transition. Backpack straps must sit naturally on top of "
        "the denim shoulders. Shadows on the jacket must follow the existing overcast "

        "black powered armor with a matte gunmetal finish and subtle metallic flake that catches "

        "POSE: Heroic wide power-stance, feet planted shoulder-width on rubble, weight centered, "
        "fists clenched at sides, chin tilted upward. Shoulders back, chest presented.\n"
        "CAMERA: Low angle (approximately 15° below eye level) looking upward to create an "
        "imposing, monumental feel. Focal length equivalent to 24mm wide-angle with slight "
        "barrel distortion for dramatic perspective.\n"

        "Shattered skyscrapers with exposed steel ribbing in the mid-ground. Flickering neon "
        "signs (OSCORP, STARK, CYBERNETICS) in the deep background. Cracked asphalt and "
        "concrete rubble underfoot. Rain-slicked surfaces reflecting the purple glow. Light "
        "rain with visible droplets in the foreground.\n"
        "LIGHTING: Dramatic cold-blue ambient fill from the twilight sky. Strong warm orange-"
        "amber accent light from distant fires camera-left. The energy veins provide purple "
        "radiosity bouncing off nearby surfaces. Strong backlight rim from a gap in storm "
        "clouds creating a divine halo effect around the character's silhouette.\n"
